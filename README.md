# Quick-Response Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Strategy[^1^][1]

## Introduction
This project presents a **few-shot dynamic obstacle avoidance technique** for mobile robots in unknown environments, leveraging advancements in deep learning algorithms and mobile platforms[^2^][2].

## Components
- **NVIDIA JetBot**: An AI kit with a NVIDIA Jetson Nano-based system[^3^][3].
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Utilized for training in a Reinforcement-Learning fashion via PyTorch[^4^][4].
- **Linux4Tegra OS**: The operating system running on Jetson Nano[^5^][5].
- **Jetpack SDK**: Includes tools and libraries for development on Jetson Nano.

## Methodology
The project involves training a CNN to enable a self-driving robot (JetBot) to navigate a fictitious road autonomously[^6^][6]. The model is trained using PyTorch and deployed on the mobile robot for obstacle avoidance recognition tests[^7^][7].

## Results
The tests conducted on the mobile robot platform showed **good performance**, validating the proposed strategy[^8^][8]. The project also discusses the potential applications and limitations of the approach.

## Future Work
Further research will focus on enabling the robot to retain information acquired in various testing contexts and improve its adaptability to different environments.
